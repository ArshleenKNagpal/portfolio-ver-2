# 02 Portfolio

## Project Description

This is a portfolio of the projects that I have helped build. I have extensive experience in front-end web development and have worked in some applications where back-end development is required.

My portfolio has screenshots of the projects that I have worked on. 
The images link to the deployed applications. The titles of the projects are linked to the repos on GitHub.
